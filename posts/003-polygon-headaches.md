Publishing this one a day late because it has been a day of headache rather than a day of "baby's first DAO".

Bridging to Layer 2 is a thing I'm just learning about and what's learning without some expensive mistakes. =P

I'm a new fanboy of Polygon, but at the same time the Layer 2 concept is pretty confusing to get into. 

Using the Polygon Bridge on their website, I thought I was bridging my Ether to Polygon. After waiting a day and not seeing any Matic in my wallet, plus doing all the research thinking I'd been scammed or delayed or transaction failures, it turns out what I actually did was bridge my Ether to "wrapped Ether" that can now be used on the Polygon Mainnet. This is annoying because I waited all day until the gas prices were seemingly low. And in the end I still have 0 MATIC.

The shitty thing is that even if I wanted to swap my wEth into Matic, I _still_ need to buy Matic first to pay the Polygon chain gas fees in Matic!

So I can do another expensive bridge transaction, presumably of Matic Mainnet Token (ERC20 coin specifically for bridging), or I can make a crypto.com account to buy Matic directly. (Keep in mind coinbase doesn't let you buy Matic directly.) I'm very wary of creating additional crypto accounts and addresses.

Anyway, lot of learnings around Layer 2 and "wrapped" tokens. Still on the path to first DAO.
