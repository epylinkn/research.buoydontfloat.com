Honestly, the state of blockchain has progressed insanely fast since I was last into it. =P

I spent the day reading up about different DAO providers. This is a completely new concept, as a few years back we had to deploy a DAO contract by hand, e.g. your own solidity contract built on top of OpenZeppelin. Basically, the idea of having a easy-to-use Heroku-like platform for deplying DAOs and interacting with them. This is going to be exciting!

On top of that all, the number of coins has really exploded and Ethereum itself has seen a few changes. First off, gas on the Ethereum Mainnet is a lot higher than I remember... pretty much back to the numbers (without the high valuations!) of the CryptoKitty era.

I'm learning about Layer 2 -- Polygon (MATIC) looks the most intriguing.
But to actually use Polygon, I have to get some... and it's not so straightforward.

I'm tired from a full night of (reading) research, so there isn't much to post here.

Some learning keywords:
- uniswap - contracts to swap between tokens
- bridge - intuitively, locking tokens on one network to use them on another network...; technically, no clue =[
