I've been trying to think about how best to create the bed for our bus. That and I wanted to get some more Fusion 360 practice for some upcoming projects.

A few iterations to come...

## Key Points:

- The "bed slats" will consist of three sheets of 1/2" ply. I initially was thinking 1x4 slats, but I think the ply is thinner and more flexible -- e.g. we can cut a honeycomb or voronoi pattern to remove some of the weight. 
- Three pieces so that we can clear the center aisle and preserve access to backdoor when we want it.
- When removing the miiddle piece to enable the aisle, I also wanted to be able to re-use the parts to create other re-usable surfaces. In this case, a platform on the left that will also be drawers, and a couch on the right.
