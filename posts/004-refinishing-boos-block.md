So, I failed at this 100 days challenge a bit earlier than expected. =P

Actually, I was really enthusiastic but it turns out my chronic neck pain (cervical radiculopathy) gets angry when I sit for too long. So I'm going to restart this as 100 Days of Making, with blockchain mixed in but not everyday.

Today, I bought some supplies to refinish a coveted Boos Block that we stumbled upon for $10. $10!!!!!
